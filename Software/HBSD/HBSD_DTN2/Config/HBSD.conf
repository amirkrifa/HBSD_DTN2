# To define this external router's endpoint, which is typically used to
# receive control messages from peer instances of the router. An example
# is meta data exchanged between the routers. DTN special-cases endpoints
# that begin with "ext.rtr/".
routerEndpoint=ext.rtr/HBSD

# Defines the multicast group the HBSD router is to join for communicating
# with the DTN daemon.
multicastGroup=224.0.0.2

# Defines the multicast port used by the DTN daemon.
multicastPort=8001

# The DTN daemon, dtnd, listens for messages from HBSD on a multicast
# socket. When HBSD sends requests to dtnd it does not want other
# DTN daemons or instances of HBSD on other systems to receive the
# multicast packets; the scope should be limited to the local host.
# This should be accomplished by setting the TTL for the socket to 0,
# but this doesn't always seem to work. Another approach is to use a
# datagram socket bound to the loopback interface. This doesn't work
# on other systems. The following defines which behavior to use. If
# set to true use a multicast source socket with a TTL of 0, otherwise
# use a source datagram socket bound to the loopback address.
multicastSends=false

# Address to bind to if multicastSends=false.
loopbackAddress=127.0.0.1

# line. The command line takes precedence. If a logging level is not

mchBufferCapacity=1000

# Specifies either to use the binSize as an expected average meeting time or to calculate online the average meeting time between nodes. Note
